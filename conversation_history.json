They're essentially saying \"I'm not supposed to be answering *your* questions; I'm supposed to be giving *you* prompts.\"\n\nThe \"Where can I add the...\" likely trails off because they're looking for a button, field, or menu option labeled something like \"Add Prompt,\" \"Submit Prompt,\" or \"New Prompt.\" They may have expected clearer instructions or a more intuitive interface."

The use of \"bro\" suggests informality and a possibly close relationship, but the overall tone can be interpreted in several ways depending on context and delivery:\n\n* **Genuine concern:**  If spoken softly and with genuine concern, it could mean the speaker believes the other person is struggling, harming themselves, or making a mistake.\n* **Condescending/Patronizing:**  If said with a sarcastic or dismissive tone, it can come across as condescending and belittling.\n* **Frustration/Exasperation:**  The speaker might be fed up with the other person's actions and expressing their frustration.\n* **Aggressive/Dominating:** Depending on the context, it could be a subtly aggressive way of telling someone to stop.\n\nWithout more information about the situation, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact meaning.  The speaker's body language and tone of voice would be crucial in understanding the intent behind the words."
